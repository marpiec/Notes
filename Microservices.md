Microservices:

- you can run more than one version of microservice at the same time
- you can only deploy one service at time
- message tracking and logging is very important (otherise what is going on?, lost packages, cycles)
- Microsevices can be disposable
- Self monitoring services instead of unit tests?
- You should have business metrics monitoring


- inverted domain like microservice identifier
